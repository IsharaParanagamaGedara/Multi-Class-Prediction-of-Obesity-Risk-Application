# Obesity Risk Prediction App

This Streamlit app predicts the risk of obesity based on various input features.

## Overview

The Obesity Risk Prediction App is a simple tool developed using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of individuals' characteristics and their corresponding obesity levels to predict the risk of obesity for a given set of input features.
